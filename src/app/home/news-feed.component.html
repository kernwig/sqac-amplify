                        Fixed bug with missing Stop / End Tip button,
                        and another that failed to load settings changed on a different device.

                        Also, a warning now pops up when a module is reused during a tip. (It tries to avoid
                        this, but now you'll know when it happens.)

                        An error with saving data to the cloud mysteriously popped out of nowhere.

                        The cloud side of SqAC has been completely rebuilt as a cloud native application in
                        AWS. I've been working on this since July, and you can read the long details in a series
                        of posts in the

                        This will only have one noticeable impact on you: new accounts!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First off, user accounts are now optional. üéâ Not having an account means that your data
                        is only save locally in your browser, and could thus go away and can't be shared to another
                        device. Thus I recommend creating a new account, but you don't have to anymore. If you had
                        content in your old account that wasn't migrated over, <a href="email:adam@fanello.net">contact me</a>
                        and I'll get it for you.

                        To be clear, <i>your old sign-in will no longer work</i>. You must create a new local or
                        cloud account on the <a href="/#/home/account">My Account</a> page.

                        Square Dance calling is done on the move, so SqAC should have mobile style user interface,
                        should it not?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        User interfaces have never been my strongest skill, but I continue to learn. While this
                        update still can't be called slick, it has taken another step toward being more like a
                        native app than a web site. The navigation menu is now under the hamburger menu at the
                        top-left corner, and documentation is now under the
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> icon at the top-right of screens
                        that have documentation. (This screen does not.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is just the beginning. My next step is a total redesign of the <i>Dance</i> screen
                        to make it more usable. I have found it... not so great. The new design will take more
                        cues from physical module cards of calling yore, while retaining the advantage of a
                        computerized assistant. Look for that upgrade in the coming months.

                <sqac-news-item date="2018-06-10" headline="Wonders of Binary Bias">
                    <p>
                        I called a guest tip last Tuesday and tried to use SqAC for it. Boy was I embarrassed
                        when it seemed like the same modules were being used over and over... and after I thought
                        I just fixed that! This weekendÔ∏è I took another look at the code and (this is nerdy, feel free to skip):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Swapped in an improved pseudo-random number generator that accounts for binary bias.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Replaced the scattershot approach to finding the best next module with a
                            targeted and consistent algorithm.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While at it, I made some related enhancements and found and fixed a couple other problems:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Added some details about how each module is chosen into the tip history display,
                            to provide a clue the next time the selection quality seems poor.
                            Also added display of start and end formation to the
                            module name displayed above the call list, because it's useful to see!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sometimes session restrictions weren't initially applied
                            to the module selector; it is now.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ignores the impossible should you select of average difficulty greater than max difficulty;
                            which would certainly skew the selections.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I split the <i>Circulate</i> family into <i>Circulate B1</i> and <i>Circulate B2</i>.
                        Even though there's really only one Circulate family, the CALLERLAB teaching order calls for
                        teaching some in Basic 1 and some later in Basic 2.
                        Also, community dance programs tend to only teach the simple (Basic 1) calls.
                        This allows you to select only <i>Circulate B1</i> for your dance session.

                    <p>
                        This release includes a hodge podge of enhancements and bug fixes to make SqAC better still.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            There was a feature to avoid using the same module twice in one tip. This never seemed to
                            work though, because it didn't. Now it does.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When naming a module, a little warning tells you in the name is already used by another
                            module. You <i>can</i> have the same name if you want, but I sure found this helpful
                            when entering 300+ new basic modules from Ceder.net.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <i>Alternative Command</i> for a call in a module may now start with text like
                            <code>(Heads/Sides)</code> or <code>(Side/Head)</code>, and the when danced it'll
                            now automatically choose one word at random and display that. This allows a single
                            get-in module to work two different ways.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I was curious about the distribution of the 383 modules now in the Ceder.net Basic
                            collection, so now after all the list of modules in a collection there's a dandy little
                            table called <i>Summary of Start &amp; End Formations</i>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Did I mention that there are now three times as many modules in the
                        Ceder.net Basic Selections collection? üéâ

                        SqAC is now supported in Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge (not IE), as well as
                        Google Chrome.

                        Bug fixes address an error that sometimes appears on Dance page, preventing accidental
                        page reload in Chrome, and ensuring that when you click to a new screen,
                        you find yourself at the top of it!

                        <p>
                            Offline support has been coming incrementally. I'm pleased to report that as of today's
                            release, you can even edit your collections offline. You're device's storage is now the
                            primary storage, with the cloud being used for backup and synchronization across devices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ah, but now the cloud storage does a bit more for you too. The last several <i>revisions</i>
                            of your collections are now preserved on the cloud. You can now click the history icon
                            <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> to see these older revisions and revert
                            back to them if you made a mistake. Cool, huh?

                            while still working as an ordinary web app on older systems.

                            There's a whole new section of the app called <span class="text-primary">Sessions</span>.
                            With it you can track multiple dancer audiences for classes or club dances.
                            Each session not only lets you toggle dance level, BPM, and difficulty for each of your
                            regular classes and dances, but also:
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                Limit which collections you want to pull modules from. After all, you probably
                                don't want to use your teaching modules at a club dance!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set which call families your dancers know. This is particularly useful at a class or
                                unusual dance level. (I'm looking at you, Club 50!)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Added a toggle switch when editing a collection (name, description, license), so
                            that you can now designate your collection as public or private.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was annoyed when calling a tip and SqAC did the same module twice in a row!
                            It'll try not to do that anymore. (It still can, if the choices are limited.)

                        <p>
                            Module editor enhancements: the call selection popup is now wider,
                            and estimated dance time now shown under the call sequence.

                        <p>
                            Finally, I took a couple steps toward making SqAC work offline. You <i>probably</i>
                            won't notice them yet, but they are steps toward that goal.

                            All of the controls on the Dance screen now function. Select the dance level,
                            continuation (resolve or keep going?), maximum difficulty, and running average
                            difficulty. This may not sound huge, but it also lays the groundwork for handling of
                            more module selection criteria to come. I'm thrilled. üòÖ

                            In this release, we have many little bug fixes and improvements, but the big change is
                            documentation! Every screen now shows helpful text on how to use it. On large screens,

                            Square Auto-Choreographer (SqAC) is now available for anyone to play with. This is still very
                            much an in-development product so let's be clear: it's buggy and incomplete!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are feeling adventurous though, here's some tips to get you started:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Click on <b>Sign In</b> in the top right <span style="font-size: 1.2em">‚Üó</span> and identify yourself.</li>
                            <li>
                                Now click on <b>Collections</b> <span style="font-size: 1.2em">‚¨Ü</span>.
                                There you'll find the four default collections that everybody starts with.
                                There's not enough there to actually dance to though. So...
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Click the <b>+ Search Online</b> (below your name, on the <i>Collections</i> page), and search for <i>Adam</i>
                                to find a few more collections that I've begun.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The ones marked <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-check"></span> on the right are what you already have.<br>
                                Click on one or more <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></span> icons to subscribe to them.
                                (As I'm writing this, the <i>Ceder.net Basic selections</i> collection
                                is the only one big enough to start dancing to.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now click on the <b>Dance</b> tab above <span style="font-size: 1.2em">‚¨Ü</span>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Click the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play-circle"></span> button to begin calling!
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Some more caveats:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Some features, including half the controls on the <i>Dance</i> page, Are just placeholders.
                                They don't do anything yet.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Yes, it is mobile friendly! I wouldn't create modules on a phone,
                                but the <i>Dance</i> page certainly works great on small screens.</li>
                            <li>
                                You generally need to be online when you start up SqAC. Once started though,
                                it'll work offline. The app will evolve to behave more like a native app with full off-line support,
                                and less like a web site.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                SqAC is being developed on Google Chrome. It <i>should</i> work with the current versions
                                of Safari, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and maybe Internet Explorer 11,
                                but they are <i>not</i> tested at this point.
                            </li>
